# rustdecoder

rustyfiles' own video engine, replacing FilmCraft in DirectLook and the preview pane.

## Why

DirectLook decoded video with FilmCraft, on the CPU. A 4K 59.94 fps HEVC Main 10 clip
(Sony XAVC HS, 77 Mbit/s) decoded at 42 frames a second on a Ryzen 7 9800X3D with nothing
else running, and stuttered under load. Media Foundation (the GPU's video engine) plays it
smoothly, so DirectLook routes videos past 1080p60 there for now (commit 32e9c58).
Media Foundation is a black box, though: no frame-exact seeking, no control over presentation,
and the MFPlay API it goes through is deprecated.

No CPU decoder plays 4K60 10-bit HEVC smoothly on ordinary machines. Fast players (mpv, VLC,
Movies & TV) hand the compressed data to the graphics card's video engine. rustdecoder does
the same, with every step around that call written here:

| Step | Who |
| --- | --- |
| Reading the container (MP4 / MOV, later MKV / WebM) | rustdecoder |
| Splitting samples into NAL units, parsing VPS / SPS / PPS / slice headers | rustdecoder |
| Reference picture management (DPB, POC, RPS) | rustdecoder |
| Filling the DXVA picture parameters, slice controls, scaling lists | rustdecoder |
| Entropy decoding, inverse transform, prediction, filters | GPU video engine (D3D11 Video) |
| YUV → RGB, scaling, rotation, presentation (swap chain) | rustdecoder (shaders) |
| Timing, A/V sync, frame-exact seeking | rustdecoder |

Frames stay on the GPU from decode to screen: no copy back to system memory.

## Crate layout

`crates/rustdecoder`, no dependency on FilmCraft or rf-app.

- `mp4` — ISO BMFF reader. Box walk, `moov` → tracks: timescale, duration, rotation (`tkhd`
  matrix), sample description (`avcC`, `hvcC`, audio), sample table (`stts`, `ctts`, `stsc`,
  `stsz`/`stz2`, `stco`/`co64`, `stss`) flattened into one list: offset, size, decode time,
  presentation time, keyframe. Fragmented MP4 (`moof`) later.
- `bits` — bit reader with Exp-Golomb and emulation-prevention removal.
- `h264`, `hevc` — parameter sets and slice headers.
- `d3d11` — video device, decoder creation by profile (H.264, HEVC Main, HEVC Main 10),
  per-frame submission, output texture array.
- `present` — NV12 / P010 shaders, rotation, HDR → SDR tone mapping.
- `audio` — PCM and AAC via the OS decoder at first; own AAC later.

## Phases

1. MP4 reader with tests against ffprobe (sample count, sizes, timestamps, keyframes).
2. Bit reader, H.264 / HEVC parameter sets and slice headers.
3. D3D11 Video decode of HEVC Main / Main 10 and H.264 High, first frame to a PNG in a test.
4. Playback in DirectLook: clock, frame queue, seeking, audio; replaces the Media Foundation
   route, and FilmCraft for video.
5. MKV / WebM, VP9 and AV1 (the GPU decodes them too), fragmented MP4.
6. Formats no GPU decodes, on the CPU: ProRes and DNxHR (intra-only, slices decode in
   parallel), MXF, AIFF. Editing sources must keep previewing.
7. FilmCraft removed in one step: dependency, `rf-player`'s FilmCraft code, texts and notes.
   Not before phases 4 and 6 cover what it plays today (decided 2026-11-09: no format may
   disappear in between).

Fallback: GPUs without a decoder for the stream (old cards, AV1 before 2020) keep the
Media Foundation route.
