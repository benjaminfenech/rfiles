rustyfiles is a file manager for Windows, written from scratch in Rust. It is meant to replace
File Explorer for everyday work: tabs, dual panes, archives you open like folders, and a
Quick Look–style previewer called DirectLook.

The window never waits on the disk. Listing, icons, thumbnails, the context menu and every file
operation run off the UI thread, so a slow network share or a folder with 100,000 files can't
freeze it.

## How fast

### Opening a folder

Time from launching the app to the folder list settling, in a new window, with the folder
already in the OS file cache. Median of five runs.

| Folder | rustyfiles | File Explorer | [Files](https://files.community) |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| 1,000 files | 93 ms | 1,113 ms | 2,640 ms |
| 10,000 files | 110 ms | 1,065 ms | 3,053 ms |
| 100,000 files | 168 ms | 1,186 ms | 11,342 ms |
| Memory after listing 10,000 files | ~40 MB | ~70 MB | ~250 MB |

Measured on one machine (Ryzen 7 9800X3D, NVMe SSD, Windows 11) on 2026-11-06. rustyfiles was
already running in the background; Explorer and Files each started a new process, and Files
loads its list incrementally, so its numbers are an upper bound. Starting rustyfiles cold
takes 350–480 ms.

### A 100,000-file folder that keeps changing

The folder open, one file selected, then about 1,000 files renamed per second in the background
for 5 seconds:

| | |
|---|--:|
| Launch to a listed folder (100,001 files) | 315 ms |
| The list follows the changes | every ~750 ms |
| Re-reading the folder (background thread) | ~70 ms |
| Work on the UI thread per update | 7–8 ms |
| Selection and cursor | stay on the selected file |

The window never waits for the folder: re-reading happens off the UI thread, and the update
itself costs less than one frame at 120 Hz. Measure it yourself with
`RUSTYFILES_TRACE_LIVE=1` and `RUST_LOG=warn,rf_app=info`.

### New tab in an open window

| Folder | Time to a settled list |
|---|--:|
| 1,000 files | ~48 ms |
| 10,000 files | ~46 ms |
| 100,000 files | ~129 ms |

Each extra tab costs about 3 MB of memory (1 tab: ~32 MB, 25 tabs: ~103 MB).

### Search by file name

`*.dll` under `C:\Windows`: 342,492 items in 116,851 folders, file cache warm.

| Method | Time |
|---|--:|
| rustyfiles | **7.8 s** |
| `dir /s /b` | 53 s |
| PowerShell `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` | 105 s |

rustyfiles searches on six background-priority threads, so the rest of the machine stays
responsive. It doesn't follow junctions, which is why it finds 454 fewer duplicates.

### Preview with Space (DirectLook)

Time from the key press to the content on screen, app already running:

| File | Content ready |
|---|--:|
| JPEG, 3840 × 2160 | 24–86 ms |
| Source code, syntax-highlighted | 23–44 ms |
| 7z archive (contents listed) | 19–31 ms |
| MP3 (tags, lyrics) | 27–32 ms |
| H.264 video, 1080p | first frame in 146–185 ms |

### Archives

Reading RAR with [rarchive](https://github.com/gelenmedya/rarchive), our own engine, against
the official UnRAR (decode and check every CRC, archives in the file cache):

| Archive | UnRAR | rarchive |
|---|--:|--:|
| 1.3 GB, 32 MB dictionary, 195 files | 2.79 s | **0.28 s** (10×) |
| 400 MB solid | 0.95 s | **0.21 s** (4.5×) |
| 400 MB, 520 files | 1.03 s | **0.063 s** (16×) |

### Copying

Copying uses its own parallel engine: 16 times faster than Explorer's on 520 files (381 MB),
about 30 times on 20,000 small files. The next engine (in the coming release) spreads small
files across folders, because threads writing into one folder wait on each other:

| 20,000 files of 4 KB in 200 folders, plus 20 files of 50 MB | Time |
|---|--:|
| Current engine | 6.8 s |
| Next engine | **3.6 s** |

It also handles name conflicts itself (replace, skip or keep both, for all or per file),
pauses and resumes, can verify every copy byte by byte, and can cap its speed.

All numbers: one machine (Ryzen 7 9800X3D, NVMe SSD, Windows 11), November 2026. The test
scripts are in the repository (`crates/rf-win/examples/copybench.rs` for copying).

## What it does

**Browsing.** Tabs you can drag to reorder or pull out into a new window. Dual pane. Details,
grid and column views, grouping, a preview pane, search, colour tags, the Shelf, libraries,
network shares and FTP. A Git status column. Folder sizes on demand: click "Calculate size".

**Files.** Undo and redo for renames, copies, moves, deleting to the Recycle Bin and folder
flattening. Bulk rename.
The full Explorer context menu, drag and drop with Explorer and the desktop, and drop targets
on tabs and pinned folders.

**Archives.** ZIP, 7z, RAR, the tar family and ISO open like folders, password-protected
ZIP, 7z and RAR included. Add, delete and rename inside ZIP, 7z and tar. Create ZIP, 7z and tar.zst on every core. Reading is
done by [rarchive](https://github.com/gelenmedya/rarchive), our own pure-Rust engine: it
decodes a 1.3 GB WinRAR archive ten times faster than UnRAR.

**Windows.** Optionally the default file manager: folders, <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>, This PC
and the Recycle Bin open in rustyfiles. Optionally, other apps' Open, Save and Select folder
dialogs open in rustyfiles too (Settings › Advanced). Explorer's `/select,` and `shell:` paths
work. Mica,
dark mode and the system accent colour. When a game or a render saturates the GPU, drawing
moves to the CPU and back again without a flicker.

**Languages.** 46 of them, following the Windows display language (or pick one in Settings ›
General). Translations start from the Files community's wording; Arabic, Hebrew and Persian are
translated but wait for right-to-left text in GPUI. Corrections are welcome: each language is one
JSON file in `crates/rf-app/locales/`.

## DirectLook

Select a file and press <kbd>Space</kbd>. DirectLook opens a preview window: video and audio
(with its own player), images, text and code, the contents of archives, and a details card
for everything else. Arrow keys move through the folder while it stays open.

It runs as its own program, `directlook.exe`, so a heavy video never weighs on the file
manager and neither can take the other down. It works in rustyfiles, and if you turn it on,
in Explorer and on the desktop too. Settings live under Settings › DirectLook.

## Install

Installing takes three clicks and no technical knowledge:

1. **[Download rustyfiles-win-Setup.exe](https://github.com/gelenmedya/rustyfiles/releases/latest/download/rustyfiles-win-Setup.exe)** (about 35 MB).
2. Open it. If Windows shows "Windows protected your PC", click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
   (The installer isn't code-signed yet; that's the only reason for the warning.)
3. That's it. rustyfiles opens by itself and is in your Start menu.

No administrator password, nothing to configure. Updates download quietly in the background and
apply the next time you open rustyfiles.

**Want folders and <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> to open in rustyfiles?** Turn on
Settings › Advanced › Set as default file manager. You can turn it off any time.

**Uninstall** like any app, from Windows Settings › Apps. Everything rustyfiles changed goes
back to File Explorer.

Prefer no installer? A portable zip is on the [Releases](https://github.com/gelenmedya/rustyfiles/releases)
page. Requires Windows 11 on x64 (Windows 10 is untested).

### Build from source

You need [Rust](https://rustup.rs) 1.95 or newer and the Visual Studio Build Tools with the
"Desktop development with C++" workload (one dependency, zstd, compiles C code).

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/gelenmedya/rustyfiles
cd rustyfiles
.\scripts\install.ps1            # builds, then installs for your user
.\scripts\install.ps1 -Default   # also makes it the default file manager
.\scripts\install.ps1 -Uninstall
```

`cargo run --release -p rf-app` starts it without installing.

### Linux

This fork builds on Linux (Wayland or X11). There's no package yet: build it from source. You
need [Rust](https://rustup.rs) 1.95 or newer, a C compiler, and these libraries:

```bash
# Arch / CachyOS / Manjaro
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel libxkbcommon-x11 wayland fontconfig freetype2

# Debian / Ubuntu (what CI uses)
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libxcb1-dev libwayland-dev libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype-dev
```

Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benjaminfenech/rustyfiles-linux
cd rustyfiles-linux
cargo run --release -p rf-app --bin rustyfiles
```

What works on Linux today: browsing with live updates, the sidebar (your XDG folders and
mounted drives), breadcrumbs and `~` in the address bar, tabs, copy, move, rename and delete
(with conflict answers, pause, speed limit and undo), the Trash (shared with other file
managers), file-type icons from your icon theme, thumbnails (shared with other file
managers; videos, PDFs and documents through the installed thumbnailers), folder sizes, Git
status, hashes, opening files with their default app or any other ("Open with" lists the
apps for the file's type, your default first), and "Open terminal here". Copy and paste
files with other apps (Dolphin, Nautilus, Thunar, browsers…) on Wayland compositors with
data-control (Hyprland, Sway, KDE) and on X11; on GNOME's Wayland session they work inside
rustyfiles only.

**DirectLook on tiling window managers.** DirectLook (<kbd>Space</kbd>) is its own window,
like Quick Look. A Wayland app can't float or place its own window, so tiling compositors tile
it unless a rule floats it. Windows have the app id `directlook` (the main window:
`rustyfiles`):

```lua
-- Hyprland, Lua config (hyprland.lua)
hl.window_rule({ match = { class = "^(directlook)$" }, float = true, center = true })
```

```bash
# Sway (~/.config/sway/config)
for_window [app_id="directlook"] floating enable
# i3 (X11)
for_window [class="directlook"] floating enable
```

For Hyprland's classic `hyprland.conf`, add a rule that floats (and centers) class
`directlook`; the rule syntax depends on your Hyprland version
([window rules](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Basics/Window-Rules/)).

Not yet: DirectLook outside the window
(Wayland has no global hotkeys), sound in video previews, and the tray icon. These show a
"not implemented on Linux yet" message instead of doing nothing. Windows-only features
(jump lists, the Open/Save dialog for other apps, the taskbar preview, auto-update) stay
Windows-only.

## Project layout

| Crate | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `crates/rf-app` | The interface, and the two programs: `rustyfiles` and `directlook` (`src/look/`) |
| `crates/rf-win` | Windows and shell integration, the file operation engine (Windows builds) |
| `crates/rf-linux` | The Linux counterpart of `rf-win`: the same modules and functions, used under its name in Linux builds |
| `crates/gpui-windows-shim` | Linux stand-in for the few calls rf-app makes into the GPUI Windows fork |
| `crates/rf-core` | The model: locations, history, entries |
| `crates/rf-archive` | Archive operations: browse, extract, create, edit |
| `crates/rf-player` | DirectLook's video and audio player |

The interface is built with [GPUI](https://gpui.rs), the framework behind the Zed editor. Its
Windows layer is a fork that adds the GPU/CPU switch:
[gelenmedya/gpui-pre-windows](https://github.com/gelenmedya/gpui-pre-windows).

<details>
<summary>Environment variables</summary>

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `RUSTYFILES_RENDERER` = `gpu`, `cpu` or `auto` | Force where the window is drawn |
| `RUSTYFILES_CONFIG_DIR` = folder | Keep settings in another folder (portable use) |
| `RUSTYFILES_MULTI_INSTANCE=1` | Allow several copies at once (tests) |
| `RUSTYFILES_FRAME_LOG=1` | Log frame times |
| `RUSTYFILES_LOOK_TRACE=1` | Log DirectLook's timings to stderr |
| `RUSTYFILES_MUTE=1` | DirectLook plays without sound (tests) |

Settings are stored in `%APPDATA%\rustyfiles\settings.toml`, DirectLook's in
`directlook.toml` next to it.

## Status

rustyfiles is young, and its author uses it every day in place of Explorer. A roadmap and
test reports will follow in `docs/`.

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome.

## Thanks

rustyfiles stands on other people's work, and borrowed a lot of ideas along the way.

[Files](https://github.com/files-community/Files) showed what a modern file manager for
Windows can be. Its feature set was our checklist, its settings and layout shaped ours, and its
approach to replacing Explorer as the default file manager guided ours. Thank you to the Files
community.

[GPUI](https://gpui.rs), the UI framework of the [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed)
editor, draws every pixel of rustyfiles on the GPU and makes a window this fast possible.
Thank you to the Zed team for building it and sharing it, and to
[Longbridge](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-kit) for gpui-kit, the components we build on.

DirectLook follows the idea of macOS Quick Look, and
[QuickLook](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook) by Paddy Xu, which brought it to Windows first.
rarchive learned the RAR format from the UnRAR source by Alexander Roshal.

Built with [windows-rs](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs),
[Velopack](https://velopack.io) (install and updates), [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) icons,
[zip](https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2), [sevenz-rust2](https://github.com/hasenbanck/sevenz-rust),
[tar](https://github.com/alexcrichton/tar-rs), [notify](https://github.com/notify-rs/notify)
and many more crates. The banner uses
